## Projects

### Project 1: Analysis of User Behavior in a Mobile Application

In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics: built a sales funnel, explored user pathways leading to purchases, and analyzed the results of an A/B test involving the introduction of new fonts. I compared the two control groups, ensured proper traffic allocation, and then compared them with the test group. It was found that the new font would not significantly impact user behavior.

### Project 2: Studying Patterns Determining the Success of Computer Games

Parameters determining the success of games in different regions of the world have been identified. Based on this, a report has been prepared for a computer game store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were conducted. 

### Project 3: Market research for catering establishments to make a decision about opening a new venue

A market research study has been prepared based on open data about public catering establishments in Moscow, and the obtained data has been visualized. Based on this data, a location has been chosen for the opening of a new coffee shop.
