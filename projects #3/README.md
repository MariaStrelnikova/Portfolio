# Market research for catering establishments to make a decision about opening a new venue.

## A market research study has been prepared based on open data about public catering establishments in Moscow, and the obtained data has been visualized. Based on this data, a location has been chosen for the opening of a new coffee shop. The construction of the graphs involved the use of the seaborn and plotly libraries.

## Results

Open data allowed to analyze Moscow's public catering market and draw conclusions regarding the development of a future startup. However, initially, the data had to be prepared for analysis â€“ duplicates had to be removed, and names had to be cleaned.

For the future startup, a bar format is recommended. First, according to the data, there are a significant number of cafes in the market (40% of all establishments), so competition in this segment could be relatively high. Second, based on the rating of streets with the highest concentration of establishments, the average number of seats on them does not exceed 50, with most accommodating fewer than 30 people on average. Such a small space could be suitable for the development of a startup and a bar concept in general.

As for the location of the future establishment, it's advisable to consider the top 10 streets but not in the very center of Moscow since rental costs there might be too high for a startup. The average capacity of visitors on these "non-central" streets does not exceed 10 seats. Overall, this size is suitable for a bar, especially if the robots don't move around the hall but instead serve drinks and make cocktails behind the bar counter.

I would also recommend starting with a non-chain establishment (as such a format requires fewer resources) and then, in the case of success, moving on to expanding into a chain.

Based on the results, the following establishment formats are more likely to be part of a chain: canteens, restaurants, and fast food establishments. This is likely because such formats are easier to replicate. Additionally, chains typically have a small number of establishments (around 6) and a modest number of seats (40). Despite bars being very rarely part of chains, our format with a unified concept - robotic bartenders - could fit into a chain format. Moreover, the average number of seats in a bar is 40. The number of bars can be limited to 4, placing them in the locations that made it into the top 10 ranking.
